# Python - Async Comprehension
This directory contains backend python projects on Asynchronous comprehension.

The following concepts will be examined during the project's execution:
- How to write an asynchronous generator
- How to use async comprehensions
- How to type-annotate generators

## Requirements
The following requirements will be taken into account when managing these projects:

- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
