# Unittests and Integration Tests
This directory contains backend python projects on Unittests and Integration Tests.

The following concepts will be reviewed during the project's management:
- The difference between unit and integration tests.
- Common testing patterns such as mocking, parametrizations and fixtures

## Requirements
The following requirements will be taken into account when managing these projects:

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated
